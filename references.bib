    abstract={The CMOS technology has been plagued by several problems in past one decade. The ever increasing power dissipation is the major problem in CMOS circuits and systems. The reversible computing has potential to overcome this problem and reversible logic circuits serve as the backbone in quantum computing. The reversible computing also offers fault diagnostic features. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanotechnology owing to its unique features like very high operating frequency, extremely low power dissipation, and nanoscale feature size is emerging as a promising candidate to replace CMOS technology. This paper presents design and performance analysis of area efficient QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin universal reversible logic gates. The proposed designs of QCA reversible Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin reversible gates utilize 39.62, 21.05, and 24.74% less number of QCA cells as compared to previous best designs. The rectangular layout area of proposed QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin gates are 52, 28.10, and 40.23%, respectively less than previous best designs. The optimized designs are realized employing 5-input majority gates to make proposed designs more compact and area efficient. The major advantage is that the optimized layouts of reversible gates did not utilize any rotated, translated QCA cells, and offer single layer accessibility to their inputs and outputs. The proposed efficient layouts did not employ any coplanar or multi-layer wire crossovers. The energy dissipation results have been computed for proposed area efficient reversible gates and thermal layouts are generated using accurate QCAPro power estimator tool. The functionality of presented designs has been performed in QCADesigner version 2.0.3 tool.}
